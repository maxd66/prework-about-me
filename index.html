      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I am, as of 4/26/2021, less than two months away from graduating
        with a neuroscience degree from the 14th ranked college in the
        world and decided that I would rather do software and web development.
        This decision is specifically because being a doctor and a dad don't go
        hand in hand and I want to raise a family with the love of my life
        Jessica.
      </p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I'm from California, but have moved around quite a bit.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I love video games, escape rooms, and sports. Creative 
        problem solving is my jam.
      </p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm applying to Med School to become a doctor, but if
        everything goes according to plan, I'll land a sweet software/
        web development job. Playstation, I'm talking to you.
      </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently live in California, but the dream is to move to 
        Washington.
      </p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I realized, a little late but better than never, that it is 
        right up my alley. I love all things technology from headphones 
        to SpaceX, and I also love creating and solving problems, so 
        it's a perfect fit.
